# React Project 4

This project covers the usage of React router.

## Overview/Summary of things learned

- Usage of different components in different routes
- Layout component and use of Outlet(react router can do nesting using this - refer to routing done in main.jsx)
- How to do routing? By using <RouterProvider router={somevariablename} /> Two ways used: <br>

1. createBrowserRouter
2. createBrowserRouter -> createRoutesFromElements

- Take dynamic values from the url -useParams() and should take care of path given in route

- API handling using loader in react router as it is a much better and optimized way (Github component)
